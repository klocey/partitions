""" 
    Functions for integer partitioning. Most apply to using integer partitioning
    to examine distributions of wealth and abundance using the feasible set. The
    feasible set is the set all forms of the distribution having the same
    constraint values (e.g. total abundance N, species richness S).
    
    Included functions:
    - conjugate(): get the conjugate of an integer partition (recoded from Sage,
      see below)
    - NrParts(): Find the number of partitions for a given total N and number of
      parts S (modified and recoded from GAP, see below)
    
    Five functions to generate uniform random integer partitions of Q having N
    parts.  Each allows the option to have partitions with zero values.
    - bottom_up(): Starts at smallest possible value of the largest possible
      part (K) 
    - divide_and_conquer(): Start at random points in the feasible set
    - top_down(): Starts at largest possible value of the largest possible part
      (K) 
    - multiplicity(): uses the top_down approach but builds the partition using
      multiplicities (i.e. multiples of parts)
    - best(): Calls one of the above functions depending on the value of Q and
      Q / N (restricted to bottom_up and divide_and_conquer for now)

    Four partitioning functions not provided in other softwares
    - most_even_partition(): Get the last lexical (i.e. most even) partition of
      Q having N parts (no zeros)
    - min_max(): Get the smallest possible maximum part a partition of Q having
      N parts (no zeros)
    - firstpart(): Get the first lexical partition of Q having N parts with k as
      the largest part (no zeros)
    - next_restricted_part(): Get the next lexical partition of Q having N parts
