partitions--Code for integer partitioning
=========================================

The code in this repository is focused on the integer partitioning problem of randomly partitioning
some total Q into N parts. These functions solve the main computational challenge of Locey and White (2013)
and extend the 'feasible set' approach based on integer partitioning to several ecological patterns and 
other distributions. 


Algorithms were derived by Ken Locey, coded into Python by Ken Locey,
and coded into R by Dan McGlinn.

Files & Folders
---------------

partitions.py --contains the primary partitioning functions.

rand_part_kdens.py --used to reveal that the functions are unbiased.

random_part_time2.py --makes time comparisons between random partitioning functions.

random_part_time_simple.py --used to find the number of seconds for generating a random partition for a
particular Q-N combination. prints time to screen.

metrics --folder containing files for evenness, diversity, inequality metrics...more to come.
