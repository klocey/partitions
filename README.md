partitions--Code for integer partitioning
=========================================

This repository contains Python and R packages for the partitioning of integers with focus on generating random partitions of a total q into n parts.

The repository also contains Python scripts for generating figures in the following manuscript:
Locey KJ, McGlinn DJ. (2013) Efficient algorithms for sampling feasible sets of macroecological patterns. PeerJ PrePrints 1:e78v1

Algorithms were derived by Ken Locey and coded into R by Dan McGlinn.

Files & Folders
---------------
**./partitions/pypartitions/**

partitions.py --contains the primary partitioning functions.

test.py --contains functions that test the function of partitions.py

testfiles --folder containing .txt files used in test.py


**./partitions/Locey\_McGlinn\_ms/**

Locey\_McGlinn\_2013.py --code for regenerating figures and conducting analyses in Locey and McGlinn (2013)

time_files.py --code to generate files that write the amount of time the new algorithms take to generate random partitions into the time_files subdirectory.

time_files --folder containing .txt files generated by time_files.py


**./partitions/metrics/**

metrics.py --functions for computing evenness, diversity, inequality of an integer partition


Installation
============
pypartitions, the python package, can be installed by cloning the directory and running the following from the command line:

    python setup.py install

rpartitions, the R package, can be installed either from CRAN or directly from git hub. 

To install the most recent stable version from CRAN use the following R command:

    install.packages('rpartitions')
    
To install the most updated version directly from github use the following R commands:

    library(devtools)
    install_github('partitions', 'klocey', subdir='rpartitions')

Altneratively the pacakge can be downloaded from github and locally installed using:

    library(devtools)
    install('rpartitions')
