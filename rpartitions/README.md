partitions--Code for integer partitioning
=========================================

The code in this package is focused on the integer partitioning problem of randomly partitioning
some total Q into N parts. These functions solve the main computational challenge of Locey and White (2013)
and extend the 'feasible set' approach based on integer partitioning to several ecological patterns and 
other distributions. 


Algorithms were derived by Ken Locey, and coded into R by Dan McGlinn. Ken Locey and Dan McGlinn both work to improve the readability
and organization of the code.
